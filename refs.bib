    abstract = {There is a lack of consensus in selecting patients who do or do not benefit from surgery when patients present with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones are present. This review aimed to give an overview of results from recent trials and available literature to improve treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis.First, an overview of different symptom criteria for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is given, based on national and international guidelines. Second, treatment outcomes (absence of biliary colic, pain-free state, biliary and surgical complications) are summarized, with data from three clinical trials. Finally, personal advice for treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is provided, based on recent trials, the available literature, and expert opinion.This review describes different guidelines and criteria sets for uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis, provides an overview of outcomes after cholecystectomy, and advises on treatment decisions in patients with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones. After cholecystectomy, biliary colic is resolved in 95 per cent of patients. However, non-specific abdominal pain persists in 40 per cent. Irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia significantly increase the risk of persistent pain. Age, previous abdominal surgery, baseline pain score on a visual analogue scale, pain characteristics, nausea, and heartburn are part of the SUCCESS criteria, and are associated with clinically relevant pain reduction after gallbladder removal.The surgical community can now give more personalized advice on surgery to improve care for patients with abdominal pain and uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis.In primary care, more than 50 per cent of patients with ultrasonographically diagnosed gallbladder stones are diagnosed with concomitant abdominal disordersLaparoscopic cholecystectomy resolves biliary colic in 95 per cent of patients; however non-specific abdominal pain persists in up to 40 per centFunctional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome significantly increase the risk of persistent pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomyPredictive factors for pain relief after cholecystectomy are older age, absence of previous surgery, pain characteristics, and absence of functional gastrointestinal disorders.},

abstract={The Japanese Society of Gastroenterology first published evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for cholelithiasis in 2010, followed by a revision in 2016. Currently, the revised third edition was published to reflect recent evidence on the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of cholelithiasis conforming to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Following this revision, the present English version of the guidelines was updated and published herein. The clinical questions (CQ) in the previous version were reviewed and rearranged into three newly divided categories: background questions (BQ) dealing with basic background knowledge, CQ, and future research questions (FRQ), which refer to issues that require further accumulation of evidence. Finally, 52 questions (29 BQs, 19 CQs, and 4 FRQs) were adopted to cover the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, complications, and prognosis. Based on a literature search using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Igaku Chuo Zasshi databases for the period between 1983 and August 2019, along with a manual search of new information reported over the past 5 years, the level of evidence was evaluated for each CQ. The strengths of recommendations were determined using the Delphi method by the committee members considering the body of evidence, including benefits and harms, patient preference, and cost--benefit balance. A comprehensive flowchart was prepared for the diagnosis and treatment of gallbladder stones, common bile duct stones, and intrahepatic stones, respectively. The current revised guidelines are expected to be of great assistance to gastroenterologists and general physicians in making decisions on contemporary clinical management for cholelithiasis patients.},

We pooled the risk ratios with a 95\% CI, also estimated adjusted number needed to treat to harm.Results Of the 40 included studies for systematic review, 39 studies with 4483 patients are included in meta-analysis. Among the risk ratios of gallstone complications, pain (0.38, 0.20 to 0.74), cholangitis (0.52, 0.28 to 0.97) and total biliary complications (0.33, 0.20 to 0.55) are significantly lower with early cholecystectomy. Adjusted number needed to treat to harm of early cholecystectomy compared with conservative management/delayed cholecystectomy are, for pain 12.5 (8.3 to 33.3), biliary pancreatitis \&gt;1000 (50{\textendash}100), common bile duct stones 100 (33.3 to 100), cholangitis (100 (25{\textendash}100), total biliary complications 5.9 (4.3 to 9.1) and mortality \&gt;1000 (100 to100 000).Conclusions Early cholecystectomy may result in fewer biliary complications and a reduction in reported abdominal pain than conservative management.PROSPERO registration number 2020 CRD42020192612.No data are available.

ABSTRACT = {Acute cholecystitis (AC), generally associated with the presence of gallstones, is a relatively frequent disease that can lead to serious complications. For these reasons, AC warrants prompt clinical diagnosis and management. There is general agreement in terms of considering early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) to be the best treatment for AC. The optimal timeframe to perform ELC is within 72 h from diagnosis, with a possible extension of up to 7–10 days from symptom onset. In the first hours or days after hospital admission, before an ELC procedure, the patient’s medical management comprises fasting, intravenous fluid infusion, antimicrobial therapy, and possible administration of analgesics. Additionally, concomitant conditions such as choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, biliary pancreatitis, or systemic complications must be recognized and adequately treated. The importance of ELC is related to the frequent recurrence of symptoms and complications of gallstone disease in the interval period between the onset of AC and surgical intervention. In patients who are not eligible for ELC, it is suggested to delay surgery at least 6 weeks after the clinical presentation. Critically ill patients, who are unfit for surgery, may require rescue treatments, such as percutaneous or endoscopic gallbladder drainage (GBD). A particular treatment approach should be applied to special populations such as pregnant women, cirrhotic, and elderly patients. In this review, we provide a practical diagnostic and therapeutic approach to AC, even in specific clinical situations, based on evidence from the literature.},
